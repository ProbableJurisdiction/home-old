      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 6): NEVADA ELECTORS FILE CONTEST; WISCONSIN RECOUNT; WAYNE COUNTY, MICHIGAN</h1>
      <p><i>As certification dates approach, things continue to heat up.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 19, 2020</b></p>
      <p>I have spent a large portion of this space covering the election-related litigation going on in state and Federal court in Pennsylvania (<i>see</i> <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-12-2020-election-litigation-part-2.html">Part 2</a>, <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-16-2020-election-litigation-part-4.html">Part 4</a>, and <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-18-2020-election-litigation-part-5.html">Part 5</a> of this series), and, to some extent, <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-14-2020-election-litigation-part-3.html">Michigan</a>. Here, I want to ensure the processes playing out in other states are covered as well. (Georgia is not included and may be covered separately.)</p>
      <h2>Nevada</h2>
      <p>The Presidential Electors for President Donald J. Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118015236/https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/nov-17-doc-2.pdf">filed an election contest</a> on Tuesday, November 17, 2020. The Electors seek either to have President Trump declared the winner of Nevada&rsquo;s electoral votes or to have no candidate declared the winner of Nevada’s electoral votes. The allegations justifying this remedy are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="font-size:24px">Illegal and improper use of a signature verification machine called the Agilis Ballot Sorting System, which is manufactured by Runbeck Election Services, and operates using Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is alleged that &ldquo;[e]lections experts and computer scientists find that signature verification machines are potentially problematic for use in elections even if they are operated flawlessly and in strict conformance with the manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications.&rdquo;</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Electors allege that the Agilis machines were not, in fact, operated in conformance with the proper specifications, making the resulting vote tallies even more unreliable.</li>
              <li>Electors allege there are an &ldquo;estimated 130,000&rdquo; of these votes.</li>
            </ul>
          <li style="font-size:24px">Use of voting machines that did not utilize encryption, leaving them vulnerable to being compromised by malicious parties.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>&ldquo;[D]uring in-person early voting, team leaders were required to remove USB drives from machines each night and log the machine&rsquo;s vote totals (hand write) on a sheet of paper that was turned into the election department. There were multiple days where the total vote counts provided on the pre-printed log sheet in the morning did not match the vote counts provided to the election department the night before. . . . In other words, votes appear to have been added to or deleted from these drives overnight during the early voting period.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>
          <li style="font-size:24px">Receipt and tabulation of votes from people who voted in other states. Electors allege there are &ldquo;no less than 15,000&rdquo; of these votes.</li>
          <li style="font-size:24px">Receipt and tabulation of votes from people who did not meet the residency requirement for voting in Nevada. Electors allege there are &ldquo;no less than 500&rdquo; of these votes.</li>
          <li style="font-size:24px">The unlawful counting of ballots submitted after deadlines.</li>
          <li style="font-size:24px">Completion and submission of mail-in ballots by people other than voters. Electors allege there are &ldquo;no less than 500&rdquo; of these votes.</li>
          <li style="font-size:24px">The unlawful exclusion of poll watchers.</li>
          <li style="font-size:24px">The Nevada Native Vote Project offering &ldquo;gift cards, gas cards, raffle entries, and t-shirts in exchange for voters coming to the polling place and casting their votes.&rdquo; Electors allege there are &ldquo;no less than 500&rdquo; of these votes.</li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Wisconsin</h2>
      <p>The Trump campaign on Wednesday, November 18, 2020, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119075523/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/trump-campaign-files-a-petition-for-recount-in-two-wisconsin-counties/">officially filed</a> for a recount in two heavily Democratic Wisconsin counties. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119002634/https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/recount-petition.pdf">recount petition</a>, the Trump campaign takes issue with the manner that many of the absentee ballots were issued, as well as the alleged exclusion of Republican poll watchers.</p>
      <p>The Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC), a bipartisan commission composed of three Democrats and three Republicans, met Wednesday night to discuss the recount procedures. Before the meeting even started, an unpleasant night was foreshadowed. The Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, Andrew Hitt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119080544/https://twitter.com/AndrewHittGOP/status/1329196275477196800">tweeted</a>,</p>
        <blockquote>BREAKING: WI Elections Commission, after seeing President Trump&rsquo;s recount petition and objections, is trying to change the recount manual at an emergency meeting tonight at 6 pm to make objections harder to make. This must be stopped.</blockquote>
      <p>Once started, the meeting eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119075302if_/https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/18/wisconsin-recount-gets-off-rough-start-elections-commission-clashes/3773591001/">devolved into partisan rancor</a>, according to the <i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i>. Republican members made known their concerns about how recount observers would be treated. &ldquo;If they can figure out a way using the pandemic to . . . make it harder to see what’s going on, to make it harder to observe, then that wouldn&rsquo;t be out of character because Democrats have been trying to do that for six months,&rdquo; Republican Commissioner Dean Knudson reportedly said. Democratic Commissioner Julie Glancey eventually erupted at her Republican colleagues, reportedly saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired of the Democrat bashing going on here.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>During the meeting, former Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119080342/https://twitter.com/Reince/status/1329273194377777153">tweeted</a>,</p>
        <blockquote>Let&rsquo;s get this straight. The Trump campaign sent the Wis Election Comm. $3 mill and filed its petition for a recount. Then the WEC immediately called a special meeting to change certain recount rules that deal with the issues brought up in the petition? You can&rsquo;t make this up!</blockquote>
      <p>The meeting ended in a deadlock on some provisions of the recount manual, the <i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i> reported. This has left some ambiguity about how to handle absentee ballots during the recount.</p>
      <h2>Michigan</h2>
      <p>On Tuesday, November 17, 2020, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers met to certify the election results for the county. Wayne County, for reference, includes Detroit. The bipartisan Board is composed of two Democrats and two Republicans. Initially, the Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118020559/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.detroitnews.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2020%2F11%2F17%2Fwayne-county-canvassers-deadlock-certifying-november-3-election-results%2F6324274002%2F">deadlocked</a> 2-2 on whether to certify the results. The two Republican members voted against certification.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the deadlocked vote, the Republican members <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119083211/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/us/politics/michigan-certify-election-results.html">changed course</a> and voted to certify the election results, provided the Michigan Secretary of State conducts an <a href="https://archive.is/C5qIF">audit</a> of precincts in the county where the vote totals did not match up with the poll books.</p>
      <p>Then on Wednesday, November 18, 2020, the Republicans on the Board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119084435/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-gop-election-checkers-rescind-certify-vote-claim-dems-bullied-them">rescinded their votes</a> certifying the results. Republican Board member William C. Hartmann signed an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119044151/https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/20201118184530537.pdf">affidavit</a> stating that he was falsely enticed into voting to certify the results with assurances that a &ldquo;full and independent audit would take place.&rdquo; The Michigan Secretary of State has said such an audit will not happen. Republican Board member Monica Palmer also signed an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119044144/https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/img-201118215108%20%281%29.pdf">affidavit</a>, in which she stated her vote to certify the results was due, in part, to statements made during a public comment period that occurred after the deadlocked vote where members of the public &ldquo;threatened [Palmer] and members of [Palmer&rsquo;s] family.&rdquo; It is unclear whether Board votes can be rescinded.</p>
      <p>The date on which Michigan initially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118002704/https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020">scheduled</a> to certify statewide election results is Monday, November 23, 2020. Keep in mind, though, that the Trump campaign still has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201116052355/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598/gov.uscourts.miwd.99598.1.0.pdf">Federal lawsuit</a> pending in Michigan, one sought remedy of which is to direct the Michigan Secretary of State &ldquo;to not certify the election results until they have verified and confirmed that all ballots that were tabulated and included in the final reported election results were cast in compliance with the provisions of the Michigan Election Code.&rdquo; If that relief is granted, then the final statewide certification date could theoretically be pushed back. The judge in the case is Janet T. Neff, a George W. Bush appointee.</p>
