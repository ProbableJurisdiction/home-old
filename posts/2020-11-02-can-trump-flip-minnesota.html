      <h1>CAN TRUMP FLIP MINNESOTA?</h1>
      <p><i>After narrowly losing the North Star State in 2016, President Trump has vowed to flip Minnesota red for the first time since 1972. Trump&rsquo;s key to victory may lie in the Iron Range.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 2, 2020</b></p>
      <p>President Trump&rsquo;s stunning 2016 victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, overshadowed the remarkable closeness of the final results in Minnesota. Hillary Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031182716/https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/election-results/2016/2016-general-election-results/">barely won</a> the state by 1.52-points and 44,765 votes. This showing stood in stark contrast to President Obama in 2012, where the incumbent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031181205/https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/election-results/2012/2012-general-election-results/">handily won</a> the North Star State by 7.69-points and 225,942 votes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181108192551/https://ballotpedia.org/Pivot_Counties_in_Minnesota">Nineteen counties</a> in Minnesota voted for Trump after voting for Obama twice: Beltrami, Blue Earth, Chippewa, Clay, Fillmore, Freeborn, Houston, Itasca, Kittson, Koochiching, Lac qui Parle, Mahnomen, Mower, Nicollet, Norman, Rice, Swift, Traverse, and Winona.</p>

      <p>The President and his team believe the road to victory in Minnesota goes through the Iron Range. The Iron Range is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031195415/https://mn.water.usgs.gov/projects/tesnar/2011/Presentations/CannonIron%20ranges.pdf">located</a> in the Lake Superior Region in the northeastern part of the state, and gets its name from the significant of iron ore and taconite (low-grade iron ore) located in the area. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031195415/https://mn.water.usgs.gov/projects/tesnar/2011/Presentations/CannonIron%20ranges.pdf">2011 report</a> from the United States Geological Survey, the Iron Range constitutes the only domestic source of iron ore and supplies about 85% of the domestic demand.</p>
      <p>If the President is going to win Minnesota, he is going to need to both peel off votes from Democratic strongholds, run up the numbers in the red counties, and flip a few more counties.</p>
      <p>I examine here data from the 2016 election data from the Iron Range, voter registration statistics, and other factors to gauge the possibility of Trump flipping Minnesota red for the first time since 1972.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Iron Range</h2>
      <p>In 2020, six Democratic mayors of Iron Range towns shocked the political world when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201021154231/https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/trump-endorsement-letter.iron-range-mayors.pdf">formally endorsed</a> President Trump for reelection, writing in an open letter announcing the endorsement:</p>
        <blockquote>The hard-working Minnesotans that built their lives and supported their families here on the Range have been abandoned by radical Democrats. We didn&rsquo;t choose to leave the Democratic Party, the party left us. . . . Donald J. Trump . . .  stood up to China, implemented tax cuts and fought for the working class. Now, four years later, the Iron Range is roaring back to life and for the first time in a very long time, locals are hopeful because of this President&rsquo;s policies and willingness to fight for us.</blockquote>
      <p>Historically, three Iron Ranges were active in this region.</p>

      <h3>Cuyana Range</h3>
      <p>The Cuyuna Range is the furthest south and west of the Iron Ranges, and is located to the north and west of Lake Mille Lacs. The Cuyuna Range saw mining began in 1907, peak in 1953, and end active operations in 1982, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031213814/https://www.minnpost.com/mnopedia/2016/04/very-brief-history-mining-cuyuna-iron-range/">according to MinnPost</a>, a nonprofit news service covering Minnesota. Since 1982, the Cuyuna Range region has &ldquo;evolved with a new identity of recreation and smaller industry,&rdquo; according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031215008/https://www.brainerddispatch.com/news/3480688-cuyuna-range">2004 report</a> in the Brainerd Dispatch. Seven cities, the Brainerd Dispatch says, have been historically associated with the Cuyuna Range: Crosby, Cuyuna, Deerwood, Emily, Ironton, Riverton, and Trommald, all of which are located in Crow Wing County.</p>
      <p>President Trump won all but one of these towns, and the final result in the one town Trump did not win outright was a tie. Here is how Trump fared in Cuyuna Range in 2016 (NOTE: &ldquo;NPV&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;Non-Presidential Voters,&rdquo; which refers to voters who voted in the 2016 general election, but did not vote for President):</p>

      <p>One additional bit of data that I found noteworthy, though I am unsure if it is predictive, is the presidential election year registration surge, which is represented in the table below:</p>

        </table>
      <p>(NOTE: <i>I only compare presidential election year registration, because Minnesota&rsquo;s reporting of voter registration numbers is sporadic in non-presidential election years.)</i></p>
      <p>This election cycle has seen the largest increase in voter registration since at least 2008. In fact, 2,967 (69.1%) of those new voters have registered since just last May in 2019. As positive of a development as this is, President Trump will need additional surges like this if he is going to flip Minnesota.</p>

      <h3>Vermillion Range</h3>
      <p>The Vermilion Range is the northernmost Iron Range and is predominantly located between the towns of Ely and Tower in St. Louis County. Each of these towns had booming mining operations. Neither has active mines today.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101031720/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ely.org%2F_site_components%2Fuploads%2Fitem_files%2Ffile-1131.pdf">written history</a>, produced by the Ely Chamber of Commerce, Ely had five mines. All of Ely&rsquo;s mines ran perpendicular to the south shores of Shagawa Lake. (<i>See</i> map below. Source: Ely Chamber of Commerce.)</p>

      <img src="/home/post-files/2020-11-02-can-trump-flip-minnesota/vermillion-range.png">

      <p>Mining in Ely coincided with the completion of the railroad in 1888, the same year the first mine, named Chandler, opened. Before long, four other mines had opened: Pioneer (1889), Savoy (1889), Zenith (1892), and Sibley (1899). The railroad was essential to the mining operations here, because it would carry the mined iron ore back to Tower, and then sent via the Great Lakes to the east where it would be used in steel production. Mining would last here until 1967, when the Pioneer mine became the last of the five mines to close. Innovation was one cause of the mining decline. According to the Ely Chamber of Commerce:</p>
        <blockquote>In 1962 new steel-making technology was introduced where oxygen was blown directly into the liquid steel through large ceramic lances. The heavily oxygenated Vermilion ore was no longer needed to make steel.</blockquote>
      <p>In Tower, the Soudan mine reigned supreme. The Soudan mine, opened in 1884, was the first iron mine in Minnesota, and is the mine that is credited as firing up the Minnesota mining industry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201102080214/https://www.mnopedia.org/place/soudan-mine-tower">according to MNopedia</a>, a project of the Minnesota Historical Society. Like its sister mines in Ely, the Soudan is no longer open, and ended operations in 1962.</p>
      <p>In 2016, President Trump narrowly won in Ely with 925 votes to Clinton&rsquo;s 799 votes. Trump also carried Tower, albeit by a narrower margin, with 126 votes, compared to Clinton&rsquo;s 112.</p>
      <p>Overall, Trump lost St. Louis County by 11.69%, or 13,141 votes, in 2016. St. Louis county is the kind of county that Trump will need to flip if he is going to win the state. There are some signs of life in the voter registration numbers. Between 2008 and 2016, the number of registered voters fell. But since 2016, over 6,000 voters have been added to the rolls. This phenomenon is depicted in the following table:</p>
        <table class="center" border="1">

          <tr>

            <td>123,666</td>
            <td>-181</td>

          <tr>
            <td>2020</td>
            <td>129,821</td>
            <td>6,155</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      <p>While the number of registered voters has not reached its 2008 peak, the numbers do appear to demonstrate a high level of enthusiasm. One area of concern, however, is that when St. Louis county had its peak voter registration in 2008, the county voted for Obama by 32.45%. This means that any enthusiasm could potentially be enthusiasm against Trump as it is enthusiasm for Trump. However, it is worth noting that even in 2012, when its rolls were at a 10,000+ deficit compared to 2008, Obama still carried the county by 29.63%. Indeed, the fact that 2012 and 2016 had almost exactly the same number of registered voters strongly suggests that many who voted for Obama in 2012 voted for Trump in 2016. Based on the levels of enthusiasm among Trump&rsquo;s supporters this year, it is entirely possible that this surge of 6,155 voters will include a hefty number of Trump voters.</p>

      <h3>Mesabi Range</h3>
      <p>The Mesabi Range is the only Iron Rage with active mining operations. The Mesabi Range runs primarily through the county of St. Louis with a small sliver crossing over into Itasca county. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031212947/https%3A%2F%2Fironrange.org%2Ftowns-of-the-mesabi%2F">Iron Range Tourism Bureau</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101032351/https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.dnr.state.mn.us%2Flands_minerals%2Fmcc_docs%2F2016_explore_iron_ore.pdf">map of the Mesabi Range</a> from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (shown below), there are thirteen towns along the Mesabi Range, one in Itasca county and twelve in St. Louis county. The lone town in Lake county is Grand Rapids. The eleven St. Louis county towns are (from west to east): Hibbing, Chisholm, Buhl, Mountain Iron, Virginia, Eveleth, Gilbert, Biwabik, Aurora, Hoyt Lakes, Embarrass, and Babbitt. Some of the towns across the range are home to several pillars of American culture. Hibbing is the hometown of Bob Dylan and Greyhound Bus Lines (which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201102214740/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/greyhound-100-years-old-and-acting-younger-than-ever/2014/07/03/4b0dbb9c-ecff-11e3-93d2-edd4be1f5d9e_story.html">since relocated</a> to Dallas, Texas). Eveleth is home to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201102214907/https://www.ushockeyhall.com/">United States Hockey Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

      <img src="/home/post-files/2020-11-02-can-trump-flip-minnesota/mesabi-range.png">

      <p>In 2016, Trump won the Mesabi Range with 13,182 votes (46.45%) to Clinton&rsquo;s 12,724 votes (44.83%). Recall that Itasca county was one of the nineteen Minnesota counties that flipped to Trump after having voted for Obama twice. If results of the Mesabi Range were calculated by county, the results would mirror the counties to which they belong. This is shown in the table below:</p>

      <p>In Grand Rapids (Itasca county), Trump walloped Clinton with 2,674 votes (50.1%), compared to Clinton&rsquo;s 2,163 votes (40.83%). These results are similar to Itasca&rsquo;s 16.35% margin in favor of Trump. Since 2016, Itasca county has registered 1,576 new voters, the biggest quadrennial increase in the five quadrennial periods since 2000, and 919 voters ahead of the average quadrennial period increase in that same time period.</p>
      <p>In the St. Louis county Mesabi Range towns, Clinton was victorious, with 10,561 votes (45.6%) to Trump&rsquo;s 10,508 votes (45.52%)—a difference of only eight hundredths of a percentage point.</p>

      <p>Based on these trends, it is likely that President Trump will earn additional votes in the traditional Iron Range towns of Minnesota. However, Trump will need to earn additional votes elsewhere if he is going to win the state.</p>

      <h2>Statewide Voter Registration Trends & Early Voting Numbers</h2>
      <p>As of October 1, 2020, an additional 267,743 voters have registered to vote since 2016. Specifically in the 78 counties Trump won, 125,938 new voters have been added to the rolls. In the 9 counties Clinton won, 141,805 new voters have registered to vote. Both of these numbers are records for new registrations. Unfortunately, Minnesota does not register voters by party, so it is difficult to truly gauge for which candidate these new voters will likely vote. Nevertheless, the pre-election day voter tallies stand at 1,868,895 in Clinton counties and 1,668,108 in Trump counties.</p>
      <p>One factor to keep in mind with respect to voter registration trends is that Minnesota is among the states that have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201103035528/https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx">same-day voter registration</a>. This means that a significant number of new voters could be added on election day.</p>
      <p>As of November 2, 2020, a total of 1,716,575 ballots have been accepted. Clinton counties account for 1,018,156 of those ballots, while Trump counties account for 698,419 ballots. Based on these numbers, Clinton counties are sitting at about 54.48% turnout, and Trump counties are at roughly 41.9% turnout.</p>
      <p>All in all, if Trump counties stay Trump counties and Clinton counties vote for Biden, then it appears to be a base election in Minnesota, with the North Star State&rsquo;s ten electoral votes going to the candidate with the better turnout operation on election day.</p>
      <p>If Trump&rsquo;s appeal in the Iron Range can permeate throughout the northeastern part of the state, then I would categorize Minnesota as only a &ldquo;Lean&rdquo; Democrat, rather than &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; or &ldquo;Likely&rdquo; Democrat. While the state&rsquo;s electoral history, not having voted Republican since President Richard M. Nixon&rsquo;s landslide reelection victory in 1972, certainly plays a factor into my calculation, I would not count Minnesota out; keep it on your list of sleeper flips that could surprise everyone on election day.</p>
