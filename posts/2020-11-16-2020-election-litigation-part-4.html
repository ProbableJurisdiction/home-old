      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 4): TRUMP&rsquo;S PENNSYLVANIA LAWSUIT HEATS UP</h1>
      <p><i>The Trump campaign amended its initial court filing on Sunday night, leading some to suggest weakness. The key: pay attention to the remedy sought.</i></p>
      <p>The Trump campaign surprised some legal observers on Sunday night when it amended its complaint in the Federal lawsuit calling into question conduct of election officials in Pennsylvania. The <i>Washington Post</i>&rsquo;s headline <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201116025539if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lawsuit-pennsylvania/2020/11/15/4aab8048-279b-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html">read</a>, &ldquo;Trump campaign jettisons major parts of its legal challenge against Pennsylvania’s election results.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Post</i> described the amended complaint as a &ldquo;pared-down&rdquo; version of the original that withdrew &ldquo;one of its most aggressive claims&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, that all ballots counted without poll watchers present are invalid). This amendment, the <i>Washington Post</i> continued, &ldquo;curtails a central part of [the Trump campaign&rsquo;s] effort to fend off the certification of the vote in the state.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Post</i> is not entirely accurate in either its description of the amendments made to the complaint or the effect of those amendments.</p>
      <p><b>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>The complaint still seeks as its primary and first request for relief &ldquo;[a]n order, declaration, and/or injunction that prohibits . . . certifying the 2020 General Election in Pennsylvania on a Commonwealth-wide basis.&rdquo;</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This tracks with what has been deemed the &ldquo;Electoral College Play.&rdquo; As Axios <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201116073320/https://www.axios.com/trump-electoral-college-biden-68d94e27-ace7-4da8-9e22-af7a62fe5149.html">reported</a>, &ldquo;Trump and his team could try to block secretaries of state in contested states from certifying results. That could allow legislatures in those states to try to appoint new electors who favor Trump over Biden.&rdquo;</li>
              <li>Crucially, Republicans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201116075106/https://ballotpedia.org/Party_control_of_Pennsylvania_state_government">control</a> both chambers of the Pennsylvania state legislature.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The complaint no longer seeks an order preventing the certification of results &ldquo;which include the tabulation of absentee and mail-in ballots for which [the Trump campaign&rsquo;s] watchers were prevented from observing.&rdquo;</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The problem I had with this type of relief is that proving which ballots were tabulated out of the presence of the Trump campaign’s observers would be incredibly difficult.</li>
              <li>This was never the primarily sought-after relief, and was even described in the complaint as &ldquo;an alternative to the first request for relief&rdquo; that could be granted if the entire certification could not be enjoined.</li>
              <li>To be sure, the complaint still contains the allegations related to exclusion of poll observers. This suggests the Trump campaign continues to view these allegations as relevant to its pursuit of an injunction of the election results on a &ldquo;Commonwealth-wide basis.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The complaint still seeks &ldquo;in addition to&rdquo; the primary request for relief, &ldquo;an order, declaration, and/or injunction&rdquo; that prohibits certifying General Election results that include &ldquo;tabulation of absentee and mail-in ballots . . . [that were] improperly permitted to be cured.&rdquo;</li>
            <ul>
              <li>We still do not know exactly how many ballots were cured. But, according to the complaint, we do know that Democratic-heavy counties were the only counties that permitted voters to cure ballots.</li>
              <li>Biden leads Trump by about 70,000 votes. Despite the fact that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Democratic-heavy counties are also the most populated, it is unlikely that 70,000 ballots were cured.</li>
              <li>The Trump campaign may be playing for a recount instead of tilting the election with this particular relief. Matt Morgan, the Trump campaign&rsquo;s chief legal counsel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201116081844/https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania-election-trump-lawsuits-legal-challenves-id-mail-ballots-commonwealth-court-20201112.html">explained</a> to the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> that, &ldquo;while none of the pending lawsuits may individually affect enough votes to tilt the outcome of the state’s election in Trump&rsquo;s favor, the campaign hoped that with a few favorable rulings . . . they could narrow Biden&rsquo;s lead to within the 0.5 point margin that would trigger an automatic recount under state law.&rdquo;</li>
              <li>I still believe this allegation, which is rooted in the Equal Protection Clause, to be the strongest one in the lawsuit.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
      <p>While the amended complaint no longer seeks to have ballots counted outside the presence of Trump campaign poll watchers thrown out, the goal of enjoining certification on a &ldquo;Commonwealth-wide basis&rdquo; still remains very much in tact.</p>
      <p>The prospects of success in enjoining Commonwealth-wide certification still appears low. However, this could simply be due to the fact that a Federal court has never (to my knowledge) enjoined such certification in a Presidential election. I would not read too much into lower court rulings on these questions for now; as we have seen throughout President Trump’s term, the only court he seems to win in is the Supreme Court.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The Pennsylvania Secretary of State has responded to the Trump campaign&rsquo;s lawsuit. I will cover this in a future letter.</p>
