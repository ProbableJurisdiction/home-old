      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 3): THE MICHIGAN LAWSUIT & PENNSYLVANIA UPDATE</h1>
      <p><i>The Trump campaign's legal arsenal takes aim at the Wolverine State.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 14, 2020</b></p>
      <p>On Wednesday, November 11, 2020, the Donald J. Trump campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111133125/https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/1.-11-10-20-trump-v.-benson-w.d.-mich.-complaint-final.pdf">filed</a> a 31-page Federal lawsuit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Michigan Secretary of State (SOS), the Michigan Board of State Canvassers, Wayne County, Michigan, and the Wayne County Board of County Canvassers.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112211950/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/trump-campaign-files-suit-in-michigan-citing-irregularities-incompetence-and-unlawful-vote-counting/">alleges</a> violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment resulting from the exclusion of Republican poll watchers and election challengers from the tabulation room, while letting Democratic poll watchers and election challengers remain, counting of illegal votes, and intimidation. Here is a sample of the allegations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;challengers designated by the Republican Party or Republican candidates were denied access to the . . . ballot counting location in Detroit while Democratic challengers were allowed access.&rdquo; (p. 10)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Many challengers testified that election officials strictly and exactingly enforced a six-foot distancing rule for Republican challengers but not for Democratic challengers. . . . As a result, Republican challengers were not allowed to meaningfully observe the ballot counting process.&rdquo; (p.11)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;At least three challengers said they were physically pushed away from counting tables by election officials to a distance that was too far to observe the counting.&rdquo; (p. 12)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Challenger Pauline Montie stated that she was prevented from viewing the computer monitor because election workers kept pushing it further away and made her stand back away from the table. . . . When Pauline Montie told an election worker that she was not able to see the monitor because they pushed it farther away from her, the election worker responded, &lsquo;too bad.&rsquo;&rdquo; (p.12)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Many challengers testified that they were intimidated, threatened, and harassed by election officials during the ballot processing and counting process&rdquo;:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>&ldquo;Articia Bomer was called a &lsquo;racist name&rsquo; by an election worker and also harassed by other election workers.&rdquo; (p. 13)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;Zachary Vaupel reported that an election supervisor called him an &lsquo;obscene name&rsquo; and told him not to ask questions about ballot processing and counting.&rdquo; (p. 13)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;Kim Tocco was personally intimidated and insulted by election workers.&rdquo; (p. 13)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;Qian Schmidt was the target of racist comments and asked, &lsquo;what gives you the right to be here since you are not American?&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 13)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;An election worker told challenger Jazmine Early that since &lsquo;English was not [her] first language…[she] should not be taking part in this process.&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 13)</li>
            </ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Challenger Kathleen Daavettila observed that Democratic challengers distributed a packet of information among themselves entitled, &lsquo;Tactics to Distract GOP Challengers.&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 13)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Election officials at the [ballot counting location in Detroit] participated in the intimidation experienced by Republican challengers when election officials would applaud, cheer, and yell whenever a Republican challenger was ejected from the counting area.&rdquo; (p. 14)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Typically, when the words &ldquo;intimidation,&rdquo; &ldquo;suppression,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; are used in relation to an election, they reference conduct occurring <i>before</i> or <i>during</i> the voting process (<i>e.g.</i>, intimidating a voter to vote a particular way or to not vote at all, paying for votes, or stealing absentee ballots and filling them out).</p>
      <p>Very little attention is paid to what happens <i>after</i> a ballot is cast. Like <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, both this lawsuit and the Pennsylvania lawsuit force attention to the issue of how votes are counted. The importance of this particular issue is paramount. As the former Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201113060340/https://books.google.com/books?id=4cl5c4T9LWkC&pg=PA270#v=onepage&q&f=false">remarked</a> to an opponent accusing him of rigging an election: &ldquo;Indeed, you won the elections, but I won the count.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>I am not aware of any Federal case on point that speaks to Equal Protection Clause violations stemming from exclusion from the vote counting process. I do not doubt that, under the right circumstances, such exclusion could constitute a violation of Equal Protection. However, without any prior cases, I cannot say with any legal certainty whether or not the allegations in the Michigan suit are sufficient to state a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
      <p>With that being said, and assuming all allegations in the complaint are true, there is at least one aspect of the complaint that might become a focal point for a future court decision. The verbal comments made by election workers to some of the poll watchers and challengers could be construed as being indicative of animus based on race and national origin (<i>e.g.</i>, being called a &ldquo;racist name,&rdquo; being told that, because &ldquo;English was not [her] first language . . . [she] should not be taking part in this process,&rdquo; and an American being asked &ldquo;what gives you the right to be here since you are not American?&rdquo;). The Supreme Court has said the &ldquo;central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.&rdquo; <i>Washington v. Davis</i>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201113204428/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10318991495621925878#p239">426 U.S. 229</a>, 239 (1976).</p>
      <p>The Trump campaign might run into some issues in trying to prove that these specific instances of racially motivated conduct were done for the purpose of harming the Trump campaign, as opposed to the specific individuals to whom the comments were directed. But if the comments were truly only directed at Republicans, then some nexus between the alleged animus and the Trump campaign might be able to be established.</p>
      <p>An additional problem may arise if the Trump campaign cannot demonstrate that this kind of conduct altered the outcome of the election. At this point in time, we have no idea how many, if any, illegal ballots were cast, or whether exclusion of Republican poll watchers and challengers affected the counting of illegal ballots. However, the election-outcome test may not need to be applied. At least within the context of voting, &ldquo;[i]n cases of outrageous racial discrimination some courts have chosen not to apply [the election-outcome test] at all, but to invalidate the election simply for its lack of integrity.&rdquo; <i>Griffin v. Burns</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6427553657037337874#p1080">570 F.2d 1065</a>, 1080 (1st Cir. 1978) (citing <i>Bell v. Southwell</i>, 376 F.2d 659 (5th Cir. 1967); <i>Hamer v. Campbell</i>, 358 F.2d 215 (5th Cir. 1966), <i>cert. denied</i>, 385 U.S. 851 (1966); <i>Brown v. Post</i>, 279 F.Supp. 60 (W.D. La. 1968)).</p>
      <p>Another factor affecting the ability to predict the outcome of this case is the fact that these types of allegations have not been strenuously litigated in Federal court before, which means there is a lack of case law on point. Therefore, the possible ways a court could interpret certain facts may not even apply. Different standards may be needed altogether. Indeed, preventing one from exercising the franchise of voting and exclusion from the vote counting process are distinct injuries. But while the injuries are distinct, the effect is the same: at least one eligible vote is not counted. A court will inevitably need to determine whether, weighing these similarities and differences, exclusion from the vote counting process is as egregious of a wrong as preventing one from voting.</p>
      <p>I can see both sides to this issue. On the one hand, if the saying &ldquo;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201113230730if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-washington-posts-new-slogan-turns-out-to-be-an-old-saying/2017/02/23/cb199cda-fa02-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html">Democracy Dies in Darkness</a>&rdquo; is true, then a court may very well find that exclusion from the vote counting process is particularly egregious, especially when accompanied by hints of racial animus. On the other hand, however, we have over a century of case law that leaves one with the impression that the act of voting is alone in its importance.</p>
      <p>One final problem is that the judiciary may not find the allegations persuasive. On Sunday, November 8, 2020, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201113232541/https://www.greatlakesjc.org/about-us/mission/">Great Lakes Judicial Center</a>, a nonprofit organization focused on litigating on behalf of conservative issues, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201113232827/https://www.greatlakesjc.org/press-release-election-fraud/">filed a lawsuit</a> in state court containing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110170849/https://www.greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Complaint-Costantino-FINAL-With-Exhibits.pdf">allegations</a> similar to the ones in the Trump campaign’s lawsuit. Six affidavits accompanied the filing. Plaintiffs also moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining certification of the election results. On Friday, November 13, 2020, that motion was <a href="https://archive.org/details/2020-11-13-order-denying-motion-for-tro">denied</a>. &ldquo;After analyzing the affidavits and briefs submitted by the parties,&rdquo; the court concluded that &ldquo;Defendants offered a more accurate and persuasive explanation of activity&rdquo; at the voting center.</p>
      <p>Before totally counting out the Trump campaign&rsquo;s lawsuit based on this ruling, a few things should be kept in mind. First, the Trump campaign was not a party to this suit. Second, the affiants for the Great Lakes Justice Center are the not the same affiants for the Trump campaign. This is important, because the judge thought the Great Lakes Justice Center affiants were too vague. Third, this was a state court ruling; the Trump campaign filed in Federal court. Fourth, appeals will surely follow.</p>
      <p>The remedy sought here is the same as in the Pennsylvania lawsuit: to enjoin certification of the final results. The analysis in my previous posts related to that type of relief applies equally here.</p>

      <h2>Pennsylvania Update</h2>
      <p>The Trump campaign was dealt a mix of wins and defeats in Pennsylvania on Thursday and Friday. On Thursday, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania <a href="https://archive.org/details/2020-11-12-pa-ballot-court-order">ruled in favor</a> of the Trump campaign&rsquo;s request to enjoin the counting of ballots where proof of identification had not been obtained by the statutory deadline.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Trump campaign was issued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201114033247/https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/philadelphia-county-boe-appeal/">five defeats</a> in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia County, where the campaign had attempted to prevent the counting of certain mail-in/absentee ballots. In total, the rulings affected about 8,300, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201114033028if_/https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/11/13/pennsylvania-courts-reject-trump-campaign-effort-to-throw-out-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-philadelphia-montgomery-county/?sh=566e04492a7e">Forbes</a>.</p>
      <p>None of these rulings impact the Federal lawsuit filed on Monday in the Western District of Pennsylvania, about which I wrote <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-14-2020-election-litigation-part-2.html">here</a>.</p>
