      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 5): RUDY RAGES AGAINST THE &ldquo;DEMOCRATIC MACHINE&rdquo; IN PENNSYLVANIA COURT BATTLE</h1>
      <p><i>The half-day long hearing featured good argumentation on both sides, a few fireworks, and a judge that sounded refreshingly neutral.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 18, 2020</b></p>
      <p>Lawyers for President Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign appeared in a Federal district court in Williamsport, Pennsylvania yesterday, Tuesday, November 17, 2020, for a hearing on whether its <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-16-2020-election-litigation-part-4.html">lawsuit</a> seeking to stave off certification of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s election results should be dismissed. Trump&rsquo;s legal team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201117232821/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327811527123103746?s=20">now headed by</a> former New York City Mayor Rudolph &ldquo;Rudy&rdquo; Giuliani, battled it out with lawyers representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and seven county Boards of Election. Though Rudy successfully represented President Trump during the Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling, the brawl in court yesterday represented Rudy&rsquo; first courtroom appearance on behalf of a client in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118085632/https://www.wtol.com/article/news/verify/1992-rudy-giuliani-last-practiced-law/507-41f75f8e-d23b-454d-a4a0-9f19310ca0ad">nearly three decades</a>.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, three issues were clearly dominant:</p>
        <ol>
          <li style="font-size:24px">Standing</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Disagreement arose regarding whether the Third Circuit&rsquo;s recent decision in <i>Bognet v. Sec'y of the Commonwealth of Pa</i>., No. 20-3214 (3rd Cir. Nov. 13, 2020) foreclosed plaintiffs&rsquo; standing in this case.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><i>Bognet</i> involved a pre-election lawsuit related to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <i>Pa. Democratic Party v. Boockvar</i>, No. J-96-2020 (Pa. Sept. 17, 2020), which judicially extended the deadline for receipt of mail-in ballots to three days after the statutory deadline and permitted the counting of such ballots even if the envelope in which they were mailed did not have a postmark verifying it was mailed by Election Day.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>The parties argued about whether the Trump campaign needed to allege the outcome of the election was affected by defendants&rsquo; conduct in order to have standing.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Defendants claimed even if all cured defective ballots were subtracted from the vote total, the results would be the same.</li>
                  <li>Plaintiffs argued that the total number of cured mail-in ballots is currently unknown. Plaintiffs also argued that all mail-in ballots that were counted outside the presence of Republican poll watchers should be thrown out, too.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          <li style="font-size:24px">The Remedy</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The parties understandably clashed over whether enjoining certification of the vote was the proper remedy.</li>
              <li>Defendants argued that such an injunction would disenfranchise the votes of millions of people—a move that would be disproportionate to the disenfranchisement of the two plaintiff voters.</li>
              <li>Plaintiffs countered that the remedy would be a remedy not only for the uncured defective ballots of the plaintiff voters, but also for the hundreds of thousands of ballots that were allegedly counted outside the presence of Republican poll watchers. Giuliani also argued that the extreme nature of the remedy is justified in light of the extreme nature of defendants&rsquo; conduct.</li>
            </ul>
          <li style="font-size:24px">The Existence or Nonexistence of Voter Fraud</li>
            <ul>
              <li>There were several confusing moments where it was unclear if the plaintiffs were making allegations of voter fraud.</li>
              <li>While Giuliani opened his argument by saying, &ldquo;[t]he best description of what we are alleging . . . is widespread, nationwide voter fraud, of which this is a part,&rdquo; the substance of the arguments seemed more about the problems with facilitating an environment—through implementation of mass mail-in voting—susceptible to such fraud and then compounding that risk by alleged partisan exclusion of Republican observers. This understanding is bolstered by Giuliani’s later statement that &ldquo;mail-in balloting is exceedingly dangerous and can much more easily be used to effectuate a voter fraud—a deliberate voter fraud.&rdquo;</li>
              <li>Plaintiffs at the very least were claiming that the defendants&rsquo; conduct, specifically the alleged exclusion of Republican observers, was potentially indicative of fraudulent behavior. The argument was that if everything was on the up and up, then there would have been no reason to exclude Republican observers.</li>
              <li>In the end, plaintiffs appeared to at least leave the door open to making more specific allegations of &ldquo;widespread&rdquo; voter fraud.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

      <h2>ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS</h2>
      <p>At one point, Rudy appeared to confuse strict scrutiny and the type of review applied to motions to dismiss. When the judge asked whether he should apply strict scrutiny for the Equal Protection claim, Rudy suggested he apply &ldquo;regular scrutiny.&rdquo; Strict scrutiny is applied to cases involving fundamental rights, such as voting. Government conduct seldom survives strict scrutiny. When evaluating a motion to dismiss, the judge usually takes the complaint at face value and assumes the allegations are true for the purpose of evaluating whether a claim has been stated.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>There was clearly no love lost between the parties. One of the defendants&rsquo; lawyers argued it was disgraceful that plaintiffs&rsquo; arguments were being made in an American court.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>An attorney from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP, which represents defendants, left a harassing and &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; voicemail for Linda A. Kerns, one of the female attorneys for plaintiffs. The attorney from Kirkland & Ellis, who is not assigned to the case, has so far gone unnamed and the precise contents of the message have not been disclosed. Kerns <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201116195914/https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057.131.0.pdf">urged the court</a> to sanction Kirkland & Ellis, because the lead attorney in the Pennsylvania case initially tried to deny that the call came from a Kirkland & Ellis attorney, &ldquo;despite the caller identification on the voicemail.&rdquo; The phone number was also confirmed via a reverse phone lookup to be from Kirkland & Ellis. Notwithstanding snide media coverage describing Kerns as &ldquo;whining,&rdquo; the judge agreed with Kerns that the lawyer’s conduct has no place in the legal profession, but stopped short of issuing sanctions.</p>
      <p>As <i>Politico</i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118075734/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/16/trump-lawyer-harassing-call-opposing-attorney-436764">reported</a>, this episode occurred against the backdrop of &ldquo;prominent figures urging law firms to back out of Trump&rsquo;s legal defense.&rdquo; The attacks on Trump&rsquo;s lawyers are justified on the ground that &ldquo;many legal experts view [the lawsuits] as fruitless and based on little or no evidence of actual fraud.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>There are several things incorrect and unsettling about these views.</p>
      <p>First, as a factual matter, there is more to these lawsuits than allegations of fraud.</p>
      <p>Second, and more importantly, the idea that someone should be deemed unworthy of legal representation because they are <i>persona non grata</i> at D.C. cocktail parties is wholly at odds with what it means to be a lawyer in the first place. Rule 1.2(b) of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118082154/https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_2_scope_of_representation_allocation_of_authority_between_client_lawyer/">states</a>, &ldquo;[a] lawyer&rsquo;s representation of a client . . . does not constitute an endorsement of the client&rsquo;s political, economic, social or moral views or activities.&rdquo; The Comment to this Rule <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201102060716/https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_2_scope_of_representation_allocation_of_authority_between_client_lawyer/comment_on_rule_1_2/">says</a> even more explicitly, &ldquo;Legal representation should not be denied to people . . . whose cause is controversial or the subject of popular disapproval.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Moreover, whether a claim is worth pursuing or not is not dependent upon the consensus of some unnamed &ldquo;experts.&rdquo; To the contrary, under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201114232720/https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_1_meritorious_claims_contentions/">Rule 3.1</a>, an attorney need only ensure &ldquo;there is a basis in law and fact for&rdquo; bringing the claim &ldquo;that is not frivolous.&rdquo; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110024327/https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_1_meritorious_claims_contentions/comment_on_rule_3_1/">Comment</a> to Rule 3.1 says a claim &ldquo;is not frivolous merely because the facts have not first been fully substantiated or because the lawyer expects to develop vital evidence only by discovery.&rdquo; Instead, a lawyer is only required to &ldquo;inform themselves about the facts of their clients&rsquo; cases and the applicable law and determine that they can make good faith arguments in support of their clients&rsquo; positions.&rdquo; Importantly, a claim &ldquo;is not frivolous even though the lawyer believes that the client&rsquo;s position ultimately will not prevail.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Many lay people likely do not know the nuances of these professional rules, and that is both understandable and acceptable. What is not acceptable is for people who know better to try and undermine and destroy <i>anyone&rsquo;s</i> existing legal representation. Their problem is with the President. Leave the lawyers out of it.</p>
