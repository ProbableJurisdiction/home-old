      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 2): THE PENNSYLVANIA LAWSUIT</h1>
      <p><i>The Trump campaign filed a Federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania yesterday. Here I analyze the legal arguments made in the complaint.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 12, 2020</b></p>
      <p>The Trump campaign on Monday filed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110185554/https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/2020-11-09-complaint-as-filed.pdf">105-page Federal lawsuit</a> against Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and the Boards of Elections of seven Pennsylvania counties (Alleghany, Centre, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Northampton, and Philadelphia). The suit alleges violations of Pennsylvania election law, disparate treatment of election observers, as well as disparate treatment of in-person and mail-in ballots. These violations, it is contended, contravene the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Trump campaign is seeking to enjoin certifying the Commonwealth-wide election results or, in the alternative, an injunction prohibiting the certification of election results in the identified counties.</p>
      <p>Here, I want to assess what I think are the weakest and strongest arguments in the lawsuit, as well as whether the sought remedy is likely to be granted if the Trump campaign succeeds on the merits.</p>
      <h2>Weakest Arguments</h2>
      <p>The weakest arguments, in my view, are those related to the “[m]isadministration of the Election by the County Elections Boards and Poll Workers.” The weakness of this argument is rooted in both the substance of the allegations and the forum in which they are brought.</p>
      <p>With respect to the substance, the complaint identifies a long list of instances where election laws were violated, including but not limited to &ldquo;poll workers mishandling spoiled ballots,&rdquo; poll workers erroneously not obtaining required signatures from voters, and potentially malfunctioning ballot counting machinery. The issue with these allegations is that they arise in the context of a lawsuit brought under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111044725/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>, which creates a Federal cause of action for constitutional violations by state officials. The First Circuit noted in <i>Griffin v. Burns</i>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111045720/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6427553657037337874">570 F.2d 1065</a>, 1076 (1st Cir. 1978), &ldquo;Circuit courts have uniformly declined to endorse action under § 1983 with respect to garden variety election irregularities.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>A &ldquo;garden variety&rdquo; election irregularity generally results from good faith errors or mistakes made lacking an intent to deprive someone of their constitutional rights. <i>Snowden v. Hughes</i>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111050623/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6284297174473978122">321 U.S. 1</a>, 8 (1944). As such, a &ldquo[m]ere violation of a state statute by an election official,&rdquo; absent some &ldquo;other willful conduct which undermines the organic process by which candidates are elected,&rdquo; is usually insufficient to establish a claim under § 1983. <i>Hennings v. Grafton</i>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111045950/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17034356575959285180&hl=en&as_sdt=2006">523 F.2d 861</a>, 864 (7th Cir. 1975); <i>see also</i> <i>Griffin v. Burns</i>, 570 F.2d at 1077 (citing approvingly <i>Hennings v. Grafton</i>).</p>
      <p>The forum in which the Trump campaign has brought these claims—Federal, as opposed to state court—may also pose challenges to obtaining a favorable ruling. This is because Federal courts appear to be extremely reluctant to wade into election contests where a remedy can be sought under state law. In <i>Powell v. Powell</i>, 436 F.2d 84 (2nd Cir. 1970), the court rejected both a § 1983 and Voting Rights Act claim resulting from &ldquo;a close congressional primary where, by mistake, a number of non-party members were allowed to vote.&rdquo; <i>Griffin v. Burns</i>, 570 F.2d at 1077 (citing <i>Powell v. Powell</i>). The rationale for the <i>Powell</i> court&rsquo;s decision was that a remedy was obtainable under New York state law. The Federal courts&rsquo; reluctance to intervene in local elections, in some instances, even extends to situations &ldquo;where racial discrimination is alleged.&rdquo; <i>Griffin v. Burns</i>, 570 F.2d at 1077 (citing <i>Hubbard v. Ammerman</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12726420625890302730">465 F.2d 1169</a>, 1177 (5th Cir. 1972), <i>cert. denied</i>, 410 U.S. 910 (1973)). However, the courts will defer to state processes so long as &ldquo;ongoing state recount and review procedures where these appear to be adequate and the alleged misconduct is lacking in &lsquo;enormity.&rsquo;&rdquo; <i>Id</i>. (quoting <i>Hubbard v. Ammerman</i>, 465 F.2d at 1177).</p>
      <p>While Federal courts are hesitant to intervene in elections for state and local office, the Federal courts have not expressed a similar reluctance with respect to elections to Federal office. This is true even when the election is held pursuant to state law. <i>See</i> <i>United States v. Classic</i>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6644395565321548796">313 U.S. 299</a> (1941) (fraud relating to a Congressional primary election). Since the allegations the Trump campaign is raising relate to a Federal election, a Federal court could well find an occasion for intervention. However, I think a Federal court intervening solely on the basis of misadministration is still very unlikely.</p>
      <h2>Strongest Arguments</h2>
      <p>The Equal Protection Clause allegations are undoubtedly the strongest in the complaint.</p>
      <p>As a bit of background, some jurisdictions provide voters the opportunity to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; defective mail-in or absentee ballots. Deficiencies can result from missing or mismatched signatures, missing witness signatures, etc. In Florida, for example, &ldquo;voters can cure their ballots simply by filling out and returning an affidavit along with a copy of an ID, such as a drivers&rsquo; license,&rdquo; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104073555/https://www.npr.org/2020/10/19/924705412/race-for-a-ballot-cure-the-scramble-to-fix-minor-absentee-ballot-problems">according to National Public Radio</a>.</p>
      <p>On October 31, 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201105150656/https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-signs-election-reform-bill-including-new-mail-in-voting/">signed into law</a> a package of amendments to the Pennsylvania Election Code, commonly referred to as Act 77. Among the amendments was the elimination of the excuse requirement for mail-in/absentee voting, which required voters to provide a valid excuse for why they would not be able to vote in-person in order to receive a mail-in/absentee ballot. What Act 77 did <i>not</i> include was a provision permitting one to cure a defective mail-in or absentee ballot.</p>
      <p>The Pennsylvania Democratic Party and a group of elected and office-seeking Democrats petitioned the Pennsylvania courts to clarify whether Act 77 required county elections boards to provide a procedure for curing defective mail-in ballots. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court eventually took up the case. <i>See</i> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201108080657/http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-96-2020mo%20-%20104548450113066639.pdf?cb=1">Pa. Democratic Party v. Boockvar</a></i> (Pa. 2020). After weighing the arguments, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that, &ldquo;although the Election Code provides the procedures for casting and counting a vote by mail, it does not provide for the &lsquo;notice and opportunity to cure&rsquo; procedure sought by Petitioner.&rdquo; The court further acknowledged that &ldquo;the decision to provide a &lsquo;notice and opportunity to cure&rsquo; procedure . . . is one best suited for the Legislature.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>This backstory is relevant, because the Trump campaign&rsquo;s complaint alleges that certain counties—heavily Democratic counties—went ahead and gave voters an opportunity to cure defects in their mail-in ballots anyways:</p>
        <blockquote>Worse, Democratic-heavy counties violated the mandates of the [Pennsylvania] Election Code and the determinations of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, advantaging voters in Democratic-heavy counties as compared to those in Republican-heavy counties. Democratic-heavy counties engaged in pre-canvass activities prior to November 3, 2020, by reviewing received mail-in ballots for deficiencies, such as lacking the inner secrecy envelope or lacking a signature of the elector on the outer declaration envelope. Those offending Counties then would notify those voters in order to allow them to cure their ballot deficiencies by voting provisionally on Election Day or cancelling their previously mailed ballot and issuing a replacement. <b><i>In other words, those counties provided their mail-in voters with the opportunity to cure mail-in and absentee ballot deficiencies, while Republican-heavy counties followed the law and did not provide a notice and cure process, disenfranchising those that themselves complied with the Election Code to cas[t] legal votes.</i></b> (emphasis added).</blockquote>
      <p>This is an explosive allegation, because it is this precise type of disparate treatment between ballots that was at issue in <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep531/usrep531098/usrep531098.pdf">531 U.S. 98</a> (2000) (per curiam). <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, we must remember, was an Equal Protection Clause case centered on the manner in which ballots were being (re)counted. What doomed the recount effort was the Florida Supreme Court’s ordering of the recount without specifying any uniform standards for determining how a voter&rsquo;s intent was to be judged based on an examination of the face of a ballot. As a result, &ldquo;the standards for accepting or rejecting contested ballots might vary not only from county to county but indeed within a single county from one recount team to another.&rdquo; <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, 531 U.S. at 106. The Court continued, &ldquo;each of the counties used varying standards to determine what was a legal vote. Broward County used a more forgiving standard than Palm Beach County, and uncovered almost three times as many new votes, a result markedly disproportionate to the difference in population between the counties.&rdquo; <i>Id</i>. at 107.</p>
      <p>Under Pennsylvania law, if a mail-in ballot contains any defects, then it must be set aside and voided. That several counties, contrary to Pennsylvania law, permitted residents to cure these defects could be viewed by a court as impermissibly giving greater weight to certain votes. If the allegations are proven true, then a court may likely find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Indeed, the counties offering opportunities to cure might be seen as similar to Broward County in <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, by using a &ldquo;more forgiving standard&rdquo; than the other counties. As Trump campaign&rsquo;s complaint alleges:</p>
        <blockquote>Because of Defendants&rsquo; conduct, voters in some counties have been and being treated differently than voters in other counties—and for no good reason. A voter in any of the counties covered by the Defendant County Elections Boards, who received notice of a defective mail-in ballot and an opportunity to cure it by correcting the ballot or casting a new one before Election Day or by casting a provisional ballot at the polling place on Election Day, has had or may have his vote counted. But voters like [Plaintiff] [David John] Henry, who received no such opportunity, will not, as their votes were rejected as having been improperly cast and thus void.</blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;This is not a process with sufficient guarantees of equal treatment.&rdquo; <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, 531 U.S. at 106.</p>
      <h2>Remedy</h2>
      <p>Assuming the court finds a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, we must examine what would be the potential remedy. As relevant here, the Trump campaign has asked the court to enjoin the certification of the 2020 election results on a Commonwealth-wide basis.</p>
      <p>While granting this type of injunction would no doubt send a strong deterrent message to rogue counties, it is unlikely that the court will grant the relief and enjoin certification of <i>all</i> the votes. As discussed in <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-10-2020-election-litigation-part-1.html">Part-1</a>, some courts distinguish between different pools of ballots. In the Florida case discussed, the court declined to invalidate the entire election, because the alleged fraud in the case only occurred with the absentee ballots. No allegations of fraud were made regarding the in-person ballots. On that basis, the court only invalidated the absentee ballots and left the in-person pool of ballots in tact.</p>
      <p>If the courts are to play a role in the process of determining which ballots ought to be invalidated, then this approach might be the best one, for it attempts to ensure as many ballots as possible are still counted. If a court does adopt this approach, then it could either invalidate all of the absentee ballots in the Commonwealth; all of the absentee ballots submitted in the counties that offered opportunities to cure mail-in ballots; or all of the cured ballots.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the approach ultimately adopted, assuming the campaign wins on the merits, I am just glad I am not the one making the call!</p>

      <p>The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Michigan on Wednesday, which I plan to cover in Part 3.</p>
