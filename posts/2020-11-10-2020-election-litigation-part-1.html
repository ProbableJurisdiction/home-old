      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 1): IN SEARCH OF A REMEDY</h1>
      <p><i>President Trump's campaign has said lawsuits related to "irregularities" and potential fraudulent conduct during the election are imminent. Here's what to look out for.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 10, 2020</b></p>
      <p>President Trump is a very litigious man, and from this litigious spirit has resulted a rich jurisprudence, whether it is related to the scope of executive privilege or congress&rsquo;s investigatory powers. Now, President Trump and his campaign appear to be readying their legal arsenal for a fight for the presidency.</p>
      <p>The President&rsquo;s lawyers, advisers, and associates have alleged irregularities and potential fraudulent conduct related to the November 3, 2020, election. While the specifics of the lawsuits remain unclear, the allegations will likely center on illegal votes being cast (e.g., dead people voting), votes unlawfully being counted (e.g., late arriving mail-in or absentee ballots), and/or procedural issues related to votes being counted (e.g., exclusion of Republican poll watchers/observers from the tabulation room).</p>
      <p>Whether there is solid evidence for these claims will play out in court. But, assuming one or all of the allegations can be proven, what would be the remedy? The short answer is that it is hard to say; to borrow a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626233306/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/04/us/gore-says-he-did-nothing-illegal-in-soliciting-from-white-house.html">phrase</a>, &ldquo;there is no controlling legal authority or case.&rdquo; However, the way Florida courts deal with these issues sheds light onto what types of relief are within the realm of possibility, as well as the type(s) of the evidence useful in proving election-related allegations. (Obviously, keep in mind that Florida is but one of 50 states. Each state is likely different in how they examine issues like this.)</p>
      <p>In the case of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110044107/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13665001053110407139"><i>In Re Protest Election Returns and Absentee Ballots</i>, 707 So.2d 1170 (1997)</a>, the District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Third Circuit, reviewed a lower court ruling that voided an election for Executive Mayor of Miami, Florida, after finding an &ldquo;extensive &lsquo;pattern of fraudulent, intentional and criminal conduct that resulted in . . . an extensive abuse of the absentee [voting] laws.&rsquo;&rdquo; In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on a combination of statistical, documentary, and testimonial evidence.</p>
      <p>At trial, political scientist and research methodology and statistical analysis expert Dr. Kevin Hill presented &ldquo;uncontradicted statistical evidence&rdquo; that demonstrated the absentee ballot fraud &ldquo;was of such consequence so as to have affected the outcome of the election.&rdquo; Specifically, Dr. Hill examined the absentee voting in Commission District 3 and found that the absentee ballots cast there &ldquo;could not be explained by any normal statistical measurement.&rdquo; Dr. Hill also testified that these results constituted an &ldquo;outlier&rdquo; and &ldquo;an &lsquo;aberrant case&rsquo; so unlikely that it was &lsquo;literally off the charts&rsquo; of probability tables.&rdquo; So off the charts, in fact, that &ldquo;[t]he odds of this occurring by chance were 5,000 to 1.&rdquo; Based on this statistical analysis, Dr. Hill &ldquo;concluded it was &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; that the absentee ballot deviation in favor of [the winning candidate] resulted only from voting fraud,&rdquo; ruling out &ldquo;almost every other conceivable possibility to a high degree of probability.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Also at trial was documents examiner Linda Hart, who &ldquo;concluded that 225 illegal absentee ballots were cast, in contravention of statutory requirements.&rdquo; FBI Agent Hugh Cochran was also present at trial, and &ldquo;identified 113 confirmed false voter addresses;&rdquo; &ldquo;14 stolen ballots;&rdquo; and &ldquo;140 ballots that were falsely witnessed.&rdquo; There were also &ldquo;more than 480 ballots were procured or witnessed&rdquo; by 29 &ldquo;ballot brokers.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Taken together, the lower court found the conduct had &ldquo;literally and figuratively, stole the ballot from the hands of every honest voter in the City of Miami,&rdquo; which resulted in &ldquo;the integrity of the election&rdquo; being &ldquo;adversely affected.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The court said this record constituted &ldquo;ample evidence of fraud to support&rdquo; the lower court&rsquo;s findings.</p>
      <p>Next, given this finding of fraud, the court had to determine the appropriate remedy. The court held the lower court erred in ordering a new election. The proper remedy, the court said, &ldquo;was to invalidate all of the absentee ballots and, thereafter, to solely rely on the machine vote to determine the outcome of the election.&rdquo; The court quoted the Florida Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110065407/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15998411339064853938"><i>Boardman v. Esteva</i>, 323 So.2d 259 (Fla. 1975)</a> for the proposition that &ldquo;&lsquo;[T]he general rule is that where the number of invalid <i>absentee ballots</i> is more than enough to change the result of an election, then the election shall be determined solely upon the basis of machine vote.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The fact that the candidate who benefitted from the fraud had no knowledge of or participation in the scheme was immaterial to the court&rsquo;s decision. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110065850/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14023448510756618098">previous Florida Supreme Court case</a> held:</p>
      <blockquote>We also reject the . . . implication that the burden of proof, with regard to fraud or corruption, is dependent upon the status of the offender. It makes no difference whether the fraud is committed by candidates, election officials, or third parties. The evil to be avoided is the same, irrespective of the source. As long as the fraud, from whatever source, is such that the true result of the election cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty, the ballots affected should be invalidated.</blockquote>
      <p>Interestingly, the court held that invalidating all of the absentee ballots did not constitute disenfranchisement, because, &ldquo;unlike the right to vote, which is assured every citizen by the United States Constitution, the ability to vote by absentee ballot is a privilege&rdquo; created by the state. Therefore, the court held, &ldquo;[i]n the absence of any findings of impropriety relating to the machine vote in this election, public policy dictates that we not void those constitutionally protected [in-person] votes.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>I am personally skeptical of the right/privilege constitutional distinction made between in-person and absentee voting. For one, I find it difficult to believe that the manner of exercising the franchise can turn the right into a privilege. Absentee voting is no doubt a convenience, but that makes it no less an exercise of a fundamental right than casting a ballot in a voting booth.</p>
      <p>Finally, the court distinguished between this case, which entailed fraud so substantial that the outcome of the election was affected, to other cases involving absentee ballot fraud on a smaller scale. Specifically, in <i>Rogers v. Holder</i>, 636 So.2d 645 (Miss. 1994), the Mississippi Supreme Court refused to invalidate all absentee ballots where &ldquo;the appellant only met his burden of proving fraud beyond a reasonable certainly as to twelve (12) absentee ballots.&rdquo; Presumably if the margin of victory was less than 12, the result would have been different.</p>

      <p>This is the first in a likely series related to election litigation.</p>
      <p>Several lawsuits were filed yesterday, so I plan to examine the complaints and provide some analysis in a follow up newsletter.</p>
