      <h1>Pollsters at War</h1>
      <p><i>The 2016 polling failures have ushered in a new wave of pollsters, polling methods, and polling skeptics that are challenging Big Polling's old guard.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | October 31, 2020</b></p>
      <p>The 2016 presidential election taught a great number of us the importance of distinguishing between national polls and state polls. National polls are indicative of the national popular vote. State polls are indicative of how many electors a presidential candidate will win in the electoral. President Trump lost the popular vote by several million votes, but won the electoral college in a landslide.</p>
      <p>The national polls in 2016 were largely correct. The state polls in the three states that arguably mattered the most—Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—were less accurate. In each of these states, the Real Clear Politics (RCP) average of polls had Clinton beating Trump in the four-way race. But here is how the race played out in each of these states:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201030213330/https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-6008.html">Michigan</a></li>
            <ul>
              <li>RCP Average: Clinton +3.6</li>
              <li>Final Result: Trump +0.3</li>
              <li>Difference: 3.9</li>
            </ul>
          <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201030220453/https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5964.html">Pennsylvania</a></li>
            <ul>
              <li>RCP Average: Clinton +1.9</li>
              <li>Final Result: Trump: +0.7</li>
              <li>Difference: 2.6</li>
            </ul>
          <li><a href="https://archive.is/tWusd">Wisconsin</a></li>
            <ul>
              <li>RCP Average: Clinton +6.5</li>
              <li>Final Result: Trump +0.7</li>
              <li>Difference: 7.2</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In Michigan and Pennsylvania, one polling firm did accurately predict Trump’s victory: The Trafalgar Group (hereinafter “Trafalgar”). In Michigan, Trafalgar gave Trump a two-point advantage, a difference 1.7 points compared to the final results. In Pennsylvania, Trafalgar gave Trump a one-point edge, a difference of 0.3 points compared to the final results.</p>
      <p>So how did Trafalgar get these states correct? According to Trafalgar’s chief strategist, Robert Cahaly, their success lies in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111031459/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/9/donald-trump-republicans-defy-nate-silver-polls/">ability</a> to coax out so-called “shy” Trump voters who support Trump, but would never admit it publicly.</p>
      <p>To get at these “shy” voters, Trafalgar asked a standard question about for whom the respondent would vote. Additionally, Trafalgar asked a “secondary” ballot test question, which asked for whom the respondent thought his or her neighbors would vote. “The general idea is that if people will not admit they personally would vote for Trump, they would admit that their neighbors would,” according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201028165724/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aapor.org%2FEducation-Resources%2FReports%2FAn-Evaluation-of-2016-Election-Polls-in-the-U-S.aspx">post-election autopsy</a> on 2016 polling conducted by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, a professional organization for public survey professionals. Trafalgar then produces the final poll results taking both questions into consideration.</p>
      <p>The so-called “neighbor” question has become quite popular, and can be seen referenced in the headlines of numerous news stories today. “Most Pennsylvanians Believe Their Neighbors Secretly Support Trump,” said a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031034809/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-15/most-pennsylvanians-believe-secret-voters-support-trump">Bloomberg</a> headline. “More voters think neighbors backing Trump over Biden,” read a headline on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031035029/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-neighbors-trump-biden-support-fox-news-poll">Fox News</a>.</p>
      <p>The fascinating aspect of this question is that it often leads to massive differences between voters’ stated preference and their neighbor’s perceived preference. For example, another headline from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031035301/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-voters-pick-biden-yet-more-think-their-neighbors-back-trump">Fox News</a> read, “Voters pick Biden, yet more think their neighbors back Trump.” In this particular poll, while most said they would vote for Biden, respondents by a 10-point margin (49-38) said they thought their neighbors supported Trump.</p>
      <p>Nate Silver, the wonderkid of polling, has taken shots at Trafalgar. In one tweet, Silver <a href="https://archive.is/RqD5X">wrote</a> that both Rasmussen (another polling firm) and Trafalgar “are not highly-rated pollsters. I would not bet on them being right this year.” Cahaly fired back, <a href="https://archive.is/n3SvO">tweeting</a> he would “take that bet” and wagered “$10k to the COVID-19 relief charity of winner’s choice.”</p>
      <p>Separately, there is somewhat of a cottage industry of poll skepticism that has formed. One YouTube channel called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RedEagleTV/videos">Red Eagle Politics</a>" (hereinafter “Red Eagle”) is a key player in this movement. One of the latest videos uploaded to Red Eagle’s channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLGqHZL-3lk">titled</a>, “WHY THE POLLS SUCK! - The Two States of the Race for the 2020 Election.” In the video, Red Eagle rails against a recent Wisconsin poll that had Biden up 17-points. Red Eagle further excoriates Nate Silver for apparently defending the poll. (As a side note, the thumbnail photograph of the video is quite humorous, and features a disheveled Nate Silver on election night 2016 (see below for the original disheveled Nate Silver photograph).</p>
      <img src="/home/post-files/2020-10-31-pollsters-at-war/nate-silver-2016-election-night.jpeg">
      <p>According to his <a href="https://archive.is/0K4f0">twitter bio</a> and YouTube videos, Red Eagle is fighting what he calls the “Election Mafia,” which consists, at least in part, of what could be considered “Big Polling” (i.e., the typical pollsters and polling firms featured in election coverage that got the 2016 election totally wrong). I personally find Red Eagle’s videos to be interesting and a good balance to the Big Polling narrative. However, I will say that I am not, and will not pretend to be, a polling expert.</p>
      <p>Trafalgar has President Trump winning Michigan and Pennsylvania again this election cycle. I find it exciting to see such open debate within the polling community, because it really gives the public a peek behind the curtain. Many take polling results at face value without digging deeper to examine things like the methodology or cross-tabs, so the debate also is an educational moment for everyone.</p>
      <p>Whether or not a new generation of innovative pollsters and polling methods is truly upon is will be determined by the most important poll of all: Election Day.</p>
