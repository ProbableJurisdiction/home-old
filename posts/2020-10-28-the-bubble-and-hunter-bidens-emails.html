    <title>The Bubble and Hunter Biden's Emails</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="entry-meta"><a class="entry-date published">October 28, 2020</a></div>
    <p>I have recently been fascinated with the debate currently going on inside the journoverse related to the New York Post’s publication of <q><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201014143214/https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2020%2F10%2F14%2Femail-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad%2F">smoking gun</a></q> emails purportedly obtained from the laptop of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and current Presidential aspirant Joe Biden. The story is significant, because it suggests that Joe Biden lied when he told the American people he and his son Hunter never discussed Hunter’s international business dealings.</p>
    <p>Particularly remarkable was the initial asymmetrical development of the story. Typically a big story will be reported and analyzed in all similarly-situated news outlets. For example, a big political story appearing in one outlet will typically be referenced by similar outlets covering politics and analyzed accordingly, irrespective of the partisan leanings of the news outlet.</p>
    <p>Here, however, the only news outlets doing original reporting on the emails and their contents are those news outlets typically perceived as having a right-of-center editorial bent (<i>e.g.</i>, New York Post, Fox News, National Review, Breitbart, etc.). Indeed, almost all of the follow up reporting on this particular story has been done exclusively by right-of-center news outlets.</p>
    <p>News outlets with a perceived left-of-center editorial bent (<i>e.g.</i>, New York Times, Washington Post, National Public Radio (NPR), etc.) have either largely ignored the underlying allegations of the New York Post’s report, or have raised procedural objections related to how the emails were obtained.</p>
    <p>(To be fair, several Progressive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpHfjBfCyyg">reporters</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcerIdm4R9A&ab_channel=TheJimmyDoreShow">commentators</a> picked up the story.)</p>
    <p>So what explains this differential media attention?</p>
    <p>Many in the right-of-center media world have alleged media bias on the part of the left-of-center media world. I think media bias is a plausible reason for the different coverage. However, I do not wish to contribute to the plethora of stories that run through past examples of purported media bias.</p>
    <p>Instead, I wish to go deeper and examine the structural issues inherent in the media landscape that may explain the resulting bias in news coverage, whether intentional or unintentional, real or perceived.</p>
    <p>When I think about media structures, I think of an analysis of Twitter clusters and information flow conducted right after the 2016 election by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007172432/http://www.electome.org/">Electome Project</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab. VICE News, which was provided exclusive access to the analysis, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201023031557/https://www.vice.com/en/article/d3xamx/journalists-and-trump-voters-live-in-separate-online-bubbles-mit-analysis-shows">summarized the results</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>MIT’s analysis — which used the social media company’s complete data set — shows that on Twitter, Trump supporters formed a particularly insular group when talking about politics during the general election. They had few connections to Clinton supporters or the mainstream media. By contrast, Clinton supporters were more splintered and verified journalists often overlapped within their mutual follower networks.</blockquote>
    <p>To say that Trump supporters on Twitter <q>had few connections to . . . the mainstream media</q> might be an understatement. According to an annotation on one of the graphics from the MIT analysis, <q><i>Almost no</i> verified journalists have a natural flow with most Trump supporters on Twitter</q> (emphasis added).</p>
