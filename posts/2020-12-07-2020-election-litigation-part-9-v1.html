      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 8): THE LADY WITH THE BLONDE BRAIDS</h1>
      <p><i>Video in Georgia raises suspicions; Pennsylvania Republicans take it up a level; and Wisconsin shows some signs of hope.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | <time datetime="2020-11-30T05:00">November 30, 2020</time></b></p>
      <p>The <a href="/home/posts/2020-12-30-2020-election-litigation-part-8.html">Electoral College Play</a> continues.</p>
      <p>We are now officially over one month into the post-election fight. In that time, two fronts in the battle appear to have formed. First, the legal front consists of legal battles waged for the purpose of either preventing certification of election results or getting certain ballots thrown out due to alleged deficiencies. Second, the legislative front has entailed attempts to convince the legislatures in key swing states to reclaim their authority under the United States Constitution and certify presidential electors to the Electoral College that will cast the State&rsquo;s electoral votes for President Donald J. Trump, instead of the State popular vote winner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.</p>
      <h2>Georgia</h2>
      <p><b><i>A Tale of Two Tapes</i></b></p>
      <p>How many ballots can fit into a suitcase? About 6,000. This was one piece of information learned on Thursday (December 3, 2020) during a hearing on alleged election irregularities before a panel of the Georgia Senate Judiciary Committee. The question was posed during the presentation of video evidence that allegedly depicts a form of ballot stuffing, and consists of closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage captured inside State Farm Arena, the location in Fulton County, Georgia, where absentee/mail-in ballots were counted.</p>
      <p>Jackie Pick, an attorney volunteer assisting the Trump Campaign in Georgia, presented the video to the committee. According to Ms. Pick, at about 10:30PM on election night, the video shows a poll worker—who has only been described, and come to be known, as &ldquo;the lady with the blonde braids&rdquo;—instructing Republican poll observers and members of the media to leave the ballot counting room, purportedly because ballot counting was done for the evening. Four or five poll workers stayed behind after the Republican observers and media left. Upon the departure of Republican observers and media, Ms. Pick continued, the video appears to show the remaining poll workers pull “suitcases” filled with ballots out from underneath a cloth-covered table and begin to run the ballots through the tabulation machines.</p>
      <p>Here is an excerpt of the video:</p>

        </video>
      <p>The video begs two questions: (1) How did the ballots get underneath the table? (2) Were the ballots underneath the table handled in a different manner than the other ballots?</p>
      <p>With respect to the first question, Ms. Pick said the legal team received the full 14-hour CCTV footage at about 1:00AM the morning of the hearing. The legal team, therefore, did not have enough time to examine the entirety of the CCTV footage in real time.</p>
      <p>Regarding the second question, Ms. Pick said, “the video is still under review, . . . but we can tell you that it appears to be an aberration from how the other ballots were handled in that room throughout that day.”</p>
      <p>New video released by the Georgia Secretary of State’s office purportedly calls into question Ms. Pick’s allegations of irregularities. The new video appears to show the ballot containers being placed underneath the table sometime around 10:00PM. The reason they were allegedly put there at that time was because the poll workers were initially told they could go home around that time. However, when Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron learned that workers were beginning to leave, he directed the supervisors at State Farm Arena to continue operations. Purportedly after receiving the directive to continue working, the video shows workers pulling the ballot boxes back out from underneath the table and pick back up processing the ballots inside. Check out the news story showing the new excerpts from the CCTV footage:</p>
      <p>This newly surfaced excerpt does appear to flatly contradict Ms. Pick’s allegations.</p>
      <p>But the problem with both of the presentations is that they are both <i>excerpts</i> of the full 14-hour video. As a result, each side is implicitly asking the public to blindly trust them—an absurd proposition, given the fact that this is a partisan conflict. Precisely because this is a partisan conflict, neither side can truly gain a majority of the public’s trust. When inherent distrust is the norm, radical transparency is required. Therefore, the full 14-hour CCTV footage should be released, so there is at least a better chance than exists now for a public consensus to be built.</p>
      <p><b><i>Exclusion of Republican Poll Workers</i></b></p>
      <p>A separate, but related issue is whether Republican poll observers were told to leave State Farm Arena at 10:30PM.</p>
      <p>Georgia State Republican Party Chair David Shafer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119013624mp_/https:/twitter.com/DavidShafer/status/1324064059214495749">first made these allegations on Twitter</a> the day after the election (November 4, 2020). Shafer specifically alleged, in part, that “Fulton County election officials told the media and our observers that they were shutting down the tabulation center at State Farm Arena at 10:30 p.m. on election night.”<b>[1]</b></p>
      <p>Election officials make two points in response to this allegation. First, they deny that observers were told to leave. Second, they attempt to assuage concerns related to the absence of partisan observers. Each is examined in turn.</p>
      <p>First, election officials <a href="https://archive.is/822U8">deny</a> that an “announcement . . . to leave” was made. Sworn witness affidavits from the two Republican observers in the room, <a href="/home/post-files/2020-12-07-2020-election-litigation-part-9/mitchell-harrison-affidavit.pdf">Mitchell Harrison</a> and <a href="/home/post-files/2020-12-07-2020-election-litigation-part-9/michelle-branton-affidavit.pdf">Michelle Branton</a>, contradict these denials. Both the affiants say that, at 10:00PM on election night, the lady with blonde braids “yelled to everyone to stop working and to return the next day at 8:30 a.m.” At 10:30PM, one affiant says Regina Waller (remember this name), the Fulton County Public Affairs Manager for Elections, also told them that ballot counting was done for the night. The observers say they left at about 10:30PM.</p>
      <p>Election officials <a href="https://archive.is/822U8">suggest</a> Republican observers may have mistakenly believed counting was done for the night. This mistaken belief would have resulted from the initial staggered dismissal of certain workers for the night.</p>
      <p>As Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron <a href="https://archive.is/822U8">explained</a> on Friday (December 4, 2020), each poll worker performed one of about four tasks at corresponding stations: (1) cutting open ballot envelopes; (2) removing ballots from secrecy envelopes; (3) flattening opened ballots so they could be processed through the ballot tabulation machine; and (4) operating the ballot tabulation machines. You can probably figure out that these tasks are listed in chronological order. Workers at the first three stations were permitted to leave “as work completed” sometime between 10:00PM and 10:30PM on election night.</p>
      <p>The dismissal of these workers was apparently not planned. Director Barron said he learned about the directive permitting poll workers to leave at or about 10:30PM, and upon learning of the directive “told them not to do that.”</p>
      <p>Fulton County Spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201206085159/https:/www.fairfieldcitizenonline.com/news/article/Correction-Election-2020-Georgia-story-15704521.php">surmised</a> that “[i]t may be possible that observers left at the time the majority of the staff left.” While plausible, this explanation is speculative. More to the point, this explanation is not mutually exclusive with the allegations made; it can both be true that Republican observers were told counting was done for the night <i>and</i> that the Republican observers left at the same time the majority of the poll workers left.</p>
      <p>Georgia State Senator Greg Dolezal argued the video suggests the Republican observers and media were told counting was done for the night. During Georgia State Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Dolezal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8A7j579eoQ&ab_channel=JDMOONAN">said</a>, “you saw the media and the observers leave the room at the same time—that tells you they were told to leave.” This explanation may be a bit more persuasive than the one Ms. Corbitt offered, but it is still speculative. Like Ms. Corbitt’s statement, Sen. Dolezal’s observation is not mutually exclusive with the State’s denial; GOP observers and the media could have left at the same time <i>and</i> the time at which they left could have been at the same time as a majority of the poll workers.</p>
      <p>Whether observers were told to leave could be settled if there was an audio recording of the encounter. However, the CCTV footage does not have sound, so there is no way to independently verify either the allegation of Republican observers or the denial of Georgia election officials.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, whether an announcement to leave was made is still factually unresolved. Because the dispute is at its core a she said/he said, absent additional evidence surfacing, the dispute is inherently unresolvable.</p>
      <p>Second, election officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201205091423/https:/www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/trumps-claims-about-georgia-lacked-facts-context/BSXOQMXVPNAXVCAEGH57OAJUSM/">say</a> the absence of GOP observers is not as catastrophic as Republicans allege, because poll workers during that time were “under the supervision of a state observer.”</p>
      <p>These initial assurances have not aged well. Director Barron <a href="https://archive.is/wnKhj">told</a> the Fulton County Board of Elections on Friday (December 4, 2020) that the state election observer, identified as one Carter Jones, did not arrive until sometime between 11:42PM-11:52PM, over an hour after the GOP observers and media crew left.</p>
      <p>Since the entire 14-hour CCTV footage has not been released, there is no way to verify Director Barron’s claim. Based on the fact that the CCTV footage shows when the GOP observers and the media crew left, the CCTV footage also would likely show when Mr. Carter arrived.</p>
      <p>But taking Director Barron at his word, the state observer arriving an hour after Republican observers and the media crew left is unlikely to assuage concerns.</p>
      <p><b><i>President Trump Officially Contests Georgia Election Results</i></b></p>
      <p>On December 4, 2020, President Trump <a href="/home/post-files/2020-12-07-2020-election-litiation-part-9/2020-12-04-ga-election-contest-petition.pdf">filed an election contest</a> in Georgia State court. The election contest was filed pursuant to Georgia law. Trump alleges “significant systemic misconduct, fraud, and other irregularities occurring during the election process” led to “many thousands of illegal votes were cast, counted, and included in the tabulations from the Contested Election for the Office of the President of the United States, thereby creating substantial doubt regarding the results of that election.”</p>
      <p>While overturning election results is a heavy lift under any circumstance, this is a relatively better path than Federal court, where the President has hit numerous roadblocks.</p>
      <h2>Wisconsin</h2>
      <p>On December 1, 2020, Trump <a href="/home/post-files/2020-12-07-2020-election-litigation-part-9/2020-12-01-wi-sup-ct-petition.pdf">files</a> a petition for original action in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, urging the court to hear his election contest. In Wisconsin, a petition for original action asks the Wisconsin Supreme Court to allow a plaintiff to bypass the traditional requirement of having to navigate through the lower courts before seeking Supreme Court review.</p>
      <p>On December 3, 2020, the Wisconsin Supreme Court <a href="/home/post-files/2020-12-07-2020-election-litigation-part-9/2020-12-03-wi-sup-ct-dismissal.pdf">dismissed</a> the petition, but on procedural grounds. Wisconsin’s election contest law explicitly says that the procedures it describes constitute the “exclusive remedy” for resolving election contests. Wis. Stat. § 9.01(11) (2017-2018). In particular, the Wisconsin Election Code says that, upon completion of a recount, a party may appeal the recount results, but must “appeal to the circuit court.” Wis. Stat. § 9.01(6)(a) (2017-2018). After the appeal court renders a decision, then appeal may be had to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The decision to dismiss Trump’s case was 4-3, meaning one of the four conservative appointees sided with the liberals on the court. In dissent, the Chief Justice wrote, “Occasionally, members of the public seem to believe that a denial of our acceptance of a case signals that the petition’s allegations are either false or not serious. <i>Nothing could be further from the truth</i>.”</p>
      <p>Some have interpreted this to mean that Trump has a chance to win if and when he appeals to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. I would not read too much into it.</p>
      <h2>Pennsylvania</h2>
      <p><b><i>State Republicans Go All Out</i></b></p>
      <p>On December 4, 2020, 76 Pennsylvania State Republican Legislators sent a letter to all Federally-elected Pennsylvania Congressmen and Senators, urging them to reject the electoral votes of the Commonwealth. Under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129185244/https:/www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15">3 U.S.C. § 15</a>, Congress has the power to reject electoral votes that are not “regularly given” and/or “lawfully certified.”</p>
      <p>This represents a significant increase in support for invalidating the electoral votes in Pennsylvania among Pennsylvania Republicans. Last week, twenty-three Pennsylvania Republicans were co-sponsors to resolutions declaring the Pennsylvania election corrupt. This week, the number of Pennsylvania Republicans supporting some method of invalidating the vote is more than triple the number of last week.</p>
      <p><b><i>U.S. Representative Mike Kelly Wins Race to the Supreme Court</i></b></p>
      <p>Last week, I covered the lawsuit of United States Representative Mike Kelly. Rep. Kelly obtained a favorable ruling in an intermediate appellate state court, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the case.</p>
      <p>On December 3, 2020, Rep. Kelly <a href="/home/post-files/2020-12-07-2020-election-litigation-part-9/2020-12-03-kelly-v-pa-scotus-emergency-application.pdf">filed an emergency application for injunctive relief</a> pending the filing and disposition for a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Applications for this type of relief are initially presented to the Justice assigned to the Circuit from which the application originated. Here, Pennsylvania is in the Third Circuit, to which Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. is assigned.</p>
      <p>Justice Alito initially requested a response from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania be filed by December 9, 2020. This date was noteworthy, because December 9 is the day after the so-called “<a href="/home/post-files/2020-12-07-2020-election-litigation-part-9/2020-10-22-crs-report-electoral-college.pdf">Safe Harbor</a>” deadline. The safe harbor deadline comes from 3 U.S.C. § 5 and says, as relevant here, that results of an election contests for presidential electors in a state are deemed conclusive so long as the election contest is concluded at least six days before the state electors meet to cast their electoral votes.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Legal Insurrection</i>, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201207083213/https:/legalinsurrection.com/2020/12/pennsylvania-dont-assume-alito-giving-until-12-9-to-respond-to-emergency-application-means-hes-letting-it-die-on-the-vine/">some chatter</a> that setting the response deadline for the day after the Safe Harbor “must be a way for Alito to let the application die on the vine, that the application would be ‘moot’ or otherwise pushing it off to make meaningful relief impossible.”</p>
      <p>Things changed on December 6, 2020, when Justice Alito <a href="https://archive.is/Nd91E">moved up</a> the response deadline to December 8, 2020, the day of the safe harbor deadline. So now people are wondering what this move tells us. Turning again to <i>Legal Insurrection</i>, the move “takes the ‘safe harbor’ issue off the table if that were an impediment to SCOTUS issuing a substantive ruling. The Justices can rule on the merits, pro or con.”</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The election contests in Georgia and Wisconsin are obviously not going to be resolved by the Safe Harbor deadline. The last time the Safe Harbor deadline was an issue was in Bush v. Gore. The Supreme Court’s decision in that case functionally allowed Florida to meet the Safe Harbor deadline. How the Safe Harbor deadline might play into an appeal Trump may file in the United States Supreme Court is unknown. But if Trump’s litigious spirit remains as fiery as it has been, then we might just find out.</p>
