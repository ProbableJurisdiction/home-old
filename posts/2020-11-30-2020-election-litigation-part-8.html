      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 8): THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE PLAY</h1>
      <p><i>A shift from the legal strategy to the political strategy appears to be afoot.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 30, 2020</b></p>
      <p>What once seemed like a futile effort to throw the election to the House of Representatives now appears to be within the realm of possibility.</p>
      <p>While many more needles must still be threaded, several developments in key battleground states may suggest the tide at least has the potential to start turning in President Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s favor.</p>
      <h2>Pennsylvania</h2>
      <p>Three events have seemingly galvanized state Republican lawmakers into trying to take back from the secretary of state and Governor the power to appoint presidential electors.</p>
      <p><b><i>Dominion Voting Systems Skips Hearing</i></b></p>
      <p>If you have been paying attention at all to post-election news coverage, then you have probably heard of Dominion Voting Systems (hereinafter &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo;), a company that supplies &ldquo;election technology&rdquo; (<i>e.g.</i>, machines and software used to cast and tabulate votes) to the United States and Canada.</p>
      <p>Dominion voting machines are used in 14 Pennsylvania counties.</p>
      <p>Since the election, more than a few seemingly outlandish allegations have been leveled against the company that I will not repeat here. Suffice it to say that the allegations were serious enough that some Pennsylvania lawmakers wanted to investigate.</p>
      <p>On November 19, 2020, Republican State Rep. Seth Grove <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129083929/http:/www.repgrove.com/News/18605/Media-Advisories/State-Government-Committee-to-Hold-Virtual-Information-Hearing-on-Voting-Machines-">announced</a> the State Government Committee would be holding &ldquo;a virtual fact-finding hearing with voting machine manufacturer Dominion Voting Systems&rdquo; the following day, November 20, 2020. But on the eve of the hearing, Dominion did the least suspicious thing possible and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129090713/http:/www.christianitydaily.com/articles/10153/20201121/dominion-refuses-to-attend-us-election-hearing-after-saying-it-would-come.htm">told the Committee</a> they would not be participating, despite earlier assurances to the contrary.</p>
      <p>Rep. Grove, reacting to Dominion&rsquo;s refusal to appear, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129085057/https:/www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/republicans-fuming-after-dominion-voting-systems-backs-out-night-before-scheduled-oversight-hearing">said</a> at a press conference, &ldquo;Why after weeks of accusations has Dominion Voting Systems not released any analysis of the success of their voting machines to the public in order to stop their accusers in their tracks? If they have nothing to hide, why are they hiding from us?&rdquo;</p>
      <p><b><i>Hearing on Election Irregularities in Gettysburg</i></b></p>
      <p>On Wednesday of last week (November 25, 2020), Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano led an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129001229/https:/www.pasenategop.com/blog/media-advisory-mastriano-and-senate-majority-policy-committee-to-vet-election-issues/">informal hearing</a> of the Senate Majority Policy Committee in Gettysburg to &ldquo;discuss 2020 election issues and irregularities.&rdquo; Present to give testimony at the hearing was President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>On Friday, November 27, 2020, Senator Mastriano <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129002447/https:/senatormastriano.com/2020/11/27/mastriano-measure-seeks-election-accountability/">announced</a> his intentions to introduce a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129002351/https:/www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20190&cosponId=32629">resolution</a> that, among other things, recognizes &ldquo;substantial irregularities&rdquo; with respect to mail-in ballots and the canvassing process, finds the 2020 Pennsylvania election &ldquo;irredeemably corrupted,&rdquo; declares the election results &ldquo;in dispute,&rdquo; and &ldquo;take[s] back and reserve[s] to the Pennsylvania General Assembly the power to designate Presidential electors.&rdquo; The resolution currently has three co-sponsors. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129003327/https:/www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&SPick=20190&cosponId=32628">identical version</a> set to be introduced in the Pennsylvania House has 20 co-sponsors.</p>
      <p><b><i>Court Decision on Constitutionality of Mail-In Ballot Law</i></b></p>
      <p>Also occurring on November 27, Judge Patricia A. McCullough of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania issued a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129010822/https:/electioncases.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kelly-v-Commonwealth-Commonwealth-Court-Opinion.pdf">memorandum opinion</a>, in a case brought by United States House Representative Mike Kelly, which held that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s mail-in ballot law likely violates the Pennsylvania constitution. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129032011/http:/www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/68%20MAP%202020%20Per%20Curiam%20Order.pdf?cb=2">dismissed</a> the lawsuit on Saturday, November 28, 2020.</p>
      <p>While the legal fight on the mail-in ballots is over, I suspect the political fight to ramp up. Judge McCullough&rsquo;s ruling will likely embolden Pennsylvania Republicans in their effort to claw back the legislature’s authority to appoint presidential electors.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
      <p>These events, taken together, give Republican state legislators a case for appointing presidential electors that can at least be made in the court of public opinion, if a court of law will not hear their grievances. The media&rsquo;s generally dismissive and scornful tone in their coverage of Republicans&rsquo; concerns could also play a role, too. Any move to take back the presidential elector appointment power would likely be portrayed as restoring the state legislature&rsquo;s Constitutional role in the presidential selection process. But beneath the surface, the root of the decision may very well be based in frustration with governmental institutions (the courts) and resentment of non-governmental institutions (the media).</p>
      <p>Those who take unprecedented actions seldom appreciate the ways the precedent can be used in the future. Think Harry Reid invoking the &ldquo;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129210455/https:/www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katenocera/harry-reid-prepares-to-go-nuclear">nuclear option</a>&rdquo; in 2013. Then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s words to Senate Democrats at the time became prophetic: &ldquo;you will regret this, and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.congress.gov/113/crec/2013/11/21/CREC-2013-11-21-senate.pdf#page=4">159 Cong. Rec. S8416</a> (daily ed. Nov. 21, 2013). With President Trump&rsquo;s third Supreme Court Justice being confirmed, an effort led by Senate <i>Majority</i> Leader McConnell, many Democrats likely regret setting the precedent for invoking the nuclear option.</p>
      <p>Everyone trusts their own judgment. But when one considers taking an unprecedented action, one must consider the judgment of others. The test for determining whether an unprecedented action is worthy of taking should resemble a cost benefit analysis. The precedent-setting politician must consider whether the short-term political gain is outweighed by what the precedent-setter will inevitably consider to be future abuse of the precedent at the hands of his or her political opponents.</p>
      <p>There are obviously no easy answers to any of these issues, but using the best possible analytical framework should hopefully produce more defensible answers than non-defensible answers. And in the world of politics, that is really all we can hope for in the end.</p>
      <h2>Wisconsin</h2>
      <p>On Sunday, November 29, 2020, Wisconsin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129203536if_/https:/www.washingtonpost.com/politics/wisconsin-recount-over/2020/11/29/b4896ade-30c9-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html">finished</a> the Trump Campaign&rsquo;s requested recount in the counties of Milwaukee and Dane. The outcome did not change. But that may not matter.</p>
      <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court appears to be moving toward approving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129053153/https:/electioncases.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WVA-v-WEC-Petition-for-Original-Action.pdf">Petition</a> to hear a case seeking to have the State&rsquo;s election results thrown out and leave the selection of presidential electors to the Wisconsin legislature. The petition for review was filed on November 24, 2020; the lead plaintiff is the Wisconsin Voters Alliance.</p>
      <p>Petitioners&rsquo;s lawsuit alleges that an estimated 12,071 legal votes were not counted and 144,736 illegal votes were counted. Petitioners base these claims on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129053136/https:/electioncases.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WVA-v-WEC-Braynard-Expert-Report.pdf">opinion of their expert witness</a>, who analyzed absentee voter data and conducted telephone surveys to determine whether there were any election irregularities.</p>
      <p>While this might appear promising, the Petition itself is very poorly written, in that it primarily relies on allegations of election misadministration, which I identified in a separate case as the &ldquo;<a href="/hoome/posts/2020-11-12-2020-election-litigation-part-2.html">weakest arguments</a>&rdquo; that could be made. In fact, Petitioners seem to base their claim almost exclusively on allegations of statutory violations. Based on my reading, the phrases &ldquo;due process&rdquo; and &ldquo;equal protection&rdquo; are not even in the motion in support of the Petition. These omissions would effectively preclude appeal to the United States Supreme Court, because there would be no issue of Federal law (<i>i.e.</i>, no claim over which the Supreme Court would have jurisdiction).</p>
      <p>Putting to one side these defects, the fact that the Wisconsin Supreme Court may hear the case is significant, because the that court has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129080212/https:/madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-conservatives-feel-snookered-by-supreme-court-justice-brian-hagedorn/article_b9e55cac-5937-5cb7-916c-dcbbfa3b8f36.html">4-3 conservative majority</a>. A favorable ruling would move the selection of presidential electors to the Wisconsin State Legislature, both houses of which are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129081011/https:/ballotpedia.org/Wisconsin_State_Legislature">controlled by Republicans</a>.</p>
      <p>On top that, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129215612/https:/www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/new-fbi-requests-files-of-people-voting-in-multiple-states">requested</a> the data cited in the lawsuit from Petitioners&rsquo; expert witness. This may suggest that Federal law enforcement officers are taking <i>this specific</i> evidence and <i>these specific</i> allegations seriously. The FBI&rsquo;s interest in this case is also noteworthy, due to the Bureau&rsquo;s apparent lack of interest in other election-related cases. Indeed, to my knowledge, this is the only publicly revealed instance of the FBI actively reaching out to, and requesting evidence from, an individual involved in election-related litigation.</p>
      <p>Whether the FBI investigation goes anywhere is not really the point. The very fact that the FBI is apparently investigating is politically potent. As we have seen over the past four years, an open investigation can be more damaging than any revelations that result from the investigation. Consider what was more damaging to President Trump: the Mueller Report or the three-year long &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; that hung over his Administration? Exactly.</p>
      <h2>Nevada</h2>
      <p>I have <a href="/home/posts/2020-11-19-2020-election-litigation-part-6.html">reported</a> that President Trump&rsquo;s Electoral College electors in Nevada filed an election contest. On November 24, 2020, the judge in that case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201130035003/https:/www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/huge-court-win-lets-trump-present-ballot-evidence-could-overturn-nevada-result">set a hearing date</a> for December 3, 2020, and will allow both sides to conduct 15 depositions. A media that is quick to point out Trump’s courtroom losses (even when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201121022317/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F11%2F13%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-loses-election-lawsuits.html">not a party to the case</a>!) has not reported this development—an unmitigated win.</p>
      <p>What will come of the hearing is uncertain. I also was unable to locate an online docket search for the Nevada court where the hearing will take place, so it may take longer than usual for me to get information about how the hearing goes.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>We have approached the final stand of the election battle. How this all will end is unknown. Regardless, it was one hell of a ride.</p>
