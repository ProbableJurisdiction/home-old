      <h1>2020 STATE BALLOT MEASURES REVEAL COMPLEXITY OF AMERICAN ELECTORATE</h1>
      <p><i>Voters are more than their partisan affiliation, and the results of these state ballot measures appear to confirm it.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | November 7, 2020</b></p>
      <p>Weed, Wages, and Gambling. Millions of voters in several states had the opportunity to cast votes on these issues. The results of some of these ballot measures, given the state&rsquo;s ballot on which they appeared, might surprise you:</p>
      <p><b>Cannabis Legalization</b> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107013739/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/04/recreational-weed-legal-arizona-new-jersey-south-dakota-montana/6160708002/">Four Reliably Red States (and One Blue State) See Green</a></p>

      <p><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107060121/https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/ballot-measures">California Propositions</a></b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>California is widely regarded as the most liberal state in the Union. But even with this progressive reputation, Golden State voters have been known to surprise everyone with how they vote on state and local ballot measures that seemingly contradict liberal orthodoxy.</li>
          <li>In 2008, the same year President Obama was elected, California voters approved Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to forbid same-sex marriage.</li>
          <li>This year, California voters again stunned many political analysts with how they voted on several state ballot measures:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101025347/https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/aca-5.pdf">Proposition 16</a></b>: voters rejected (56.5%-43.5%) an attempt to repeal antidiscrimination provisions from the California constitution that prohibited discrimination and granting preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education, or contracting. Supporters billed the move as &ldquo;affirmative action.&rdquo; Many of Prop 16&rsquo;s opponents were Asian-Americans, who believed, as the Sacramento Bee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201106204814/https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article246562743.html">reported</a>, using race as a factor in the context of education could &ldquo;lead to diminished opportunities for Asian American applicants.&rdquo; The Los Angeles Times called voters&rsquo; rejection of Prop 16 &ldquo;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107014558/https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-11-05/proposition-16-fails-affirmative-action">a shame</a>.&rdquo;</li>
              <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201021035120/https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/aca-4.pdf">Proposition 18</a></b>: voters rejected (55.5%-45.5%) a move to grant 17-year-olds the ability the vote in a primary election if they would be 18-years-old by the time of the next general election.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Democrats have urged the lowering of the voting age. In 2019, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107063842/https://thehill.com/homenews/house/434115-pelosi-says-she-backs-lowering-voting-age-to-16">publicly supported</a> lowering the voting age to 16. Ironically, Pelosi&rsquo;s constituents seem to disagree. Voters in San Francisco, where Pelosi&rsquo;s House District is located, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107070835/https://sfelections.sfgov.org/november-3-2020-election-results-summary">appear</a> to have also rejected <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201012141526/https://sfelections.sfgov.org/sites/default/files/Documents/candidates/2020Nov/20200717_16and17YearOldsVotingInMunicipalElections.pdf">Proposition G</a>, a local measure that would have permitted 16-year-olds the ability to vote in local elections for local candidates and local ballot measures if they are U.S. citizens and registered to vote.</li>
                </ul>
              <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101103924/https://www.oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/19-0001%20%28Rental%20Affordability%20Act%29.pdf">Proposition 21</a></b>: voters rejected (59.9%-40.1%) a move to expand the state&rsquo;s rent control authority.</li>
              <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201103195941/https://www.oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/19-0026A1%20%28App-Based%20Drivers%29.pdf">Proposition 22</a></b>: voters approved (58.6%-41.4%) classifying &ldquo;rideshare&rdquo; drivers (e.g., Uber, Lyft, etc.) as &ldquo;independent contractors,&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;employees.&rdquo; This is a big win for rideshare companies, because if their drivers were classified as &ldquo;employees,&rdquo; then they would be covered by the state&rsquo;s laws related to minimum wage, overtime, unemployment insurance, and workers&rsquo; compensation.</li>
              <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101093548/https://www.oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/18-0009%20%28Referendum%20of%20SB%2010%29.pdf">Proposition 25</a></b>: voters rejected (55.8%-44.2%) eliminating cash bail. Ending cash bail is one of the rallying cries for progressives. The argument in favor is intuitiveâ€”lack of money should not be the reason one is detained pretrial, especially if he or she poses no risk to the community. While voters have spoken on the state level, district attorneys on the local level have the ability to affect change on this issue. Earlier this year, the San Francisco DA, Chesa Boudin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107075040/https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/San-Francisco-DA-Chesa-Boudin-ends-cash-bail-for-14996400.php">eliminated cash bail</a> for all criminal offenses. Similarly, the Vermont State Attorney in Chittenden County, which is the county in which Burlington is located, Sarah George <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107075600/https://filtermag.org/vermont-eliminate-cash-bail/">said</a> her office would no longer request cash bail.</li>

      <p><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107080158/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-minimum-wage-approves-pay-hike/">Florida Hikes Minimum Wage to $15</a></b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Florida has now voted for Trump twice. The first time by 1.2%, this time by 3.4%.</li>
          <li>So in 2020, Florida voters of course did the most Republican thing ever and raised the state&rsquo;s minimum wage to $15. I kid. Republicans have typically resisted attempts to raise the minimum wage. Whatever their affinity for Republican politicians, over 60% of voters voted in favor of the increase.</li>
        </ul>
      <p><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107081639/https://www.1011now.com/2020/11/04/gambling-bills-have-good-odds-of-passing/">Nebraska (Finally) Approves Gambling, Taxing the Hell Out of It</a></b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nebraska is one of the most reliably Republican states in the country, having last given all of its electoral votes to a Democratic presidential candidate in 1964 to Lyndon B. Johnson.</li>
          <li>On the ballot this year were three initiatives: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104151105/https://sos.nebraska.gov/sites/sos.nebraska.gov/files/doc/elections/2020/Init.%20Measures%20428-431%20Pamphlet.pdf">429, 430, and 431</a>, all of which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107082740/https://electionresults.nebraska.gov/resultsSW.aspx?text=Race&type=PA&map=CTY">passed</a>.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Initiative 429 amended the state constitution to allow for laws authorizing, regulating, and taxing casino gambling at racetracks in the state. Voters approved this initiative 64.97%-35.03%.</li>
              <li>Initiative 430 legalized casino gambling at racetracks in the state. Voters approved this initiative 64.93%-35.07%.</li>
              <li>Initiative 431 imposes an annual 20% tax on gross gaming revenue from casino gambling at racetracks in the state. Voters approved this initiative 68.66%-31.34%.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>There have been several attempts to legalize gambling in Nebraska.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In 2004, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107083557/https://sos.nebraska.gov/sites/sos.nebraska.gov/files/doc/elections/2004/2004_gen_ca_init.pdf">Initiatives 417, 419, and 420</a>, attempted to do the same thing. However, the Initiative that would have amended the state constitution to permit the enactment of those laws, Initiative 417, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107083624/https://sos.nebraska.gov/sites/sos.nebraska.gov/files/doc/2004%20General.pdf">narrowly rejected</a> (51.1%-48.9%). This meant that even if the other provisions passed, there would be no authority to act on them. The taxing provision, Initiative 419, passed (51.%-48.9%), while the decriminalization provision did not (52.8%-47.2%).</li>
              <li>In 2016, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107084854/https://nebraska.tv/newsletter-daily/long-elusive-casino-gambling-on-the-ballot-in-nebraska">an effort</a> to get a gambling initiative on the ballot, but it ultimately failed.</li>
              <li>I guess the third time&rsquo;s a charm.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Republicans have generally been against both gambling and taxes. So the fact that Nebraska voters approved not only gambling, but also a very stiff tax, is remarkable.</li>
        </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>The results of these initiatives and the seeming contradiction with the perceived political attitudes of the states suggest voters are a bit more complex than the &ldquo;D&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&rdquo; next to their name. Perhaps it suggests that there are certain issues that voters are willing to take up personally a la carte, but which are not ones that would drive them to vote against a candidate that shares their general set of views on a wider variety of issues. Indeed, to expect someone to abandon that general set of views would functionally require voters to become single-issue voters on some boutique issues.</p>
